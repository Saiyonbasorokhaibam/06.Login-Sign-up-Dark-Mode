✨ Login Sign up- Dark Mode (HTML + CSS)


This is a modern sign-up page UI I made using only HTML and CSS.
The design is inspired by a Dribbble layout, with a clean and minimal purple theme.


💡 What I Built

A two-part layout:
Left side with an image and quote

Right side with the sign-up form

Smooth double background for a soft, glowing look

Glass effect card using backdrop-filter

Google and Apple sign-up buttons

Simple and clean typography]
